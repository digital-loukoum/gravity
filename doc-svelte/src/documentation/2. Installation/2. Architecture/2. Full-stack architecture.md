In this architecture, you will use a full-stack framework like [SvelteKit](kit.svelte.dev), [Next](nextjs.org) or [Nuxt](v3.nuxtjs.org/).

These kind of frameworks are called **full-stack** because you define your server as well as your client in **one application**.

It makes development and deployment simpler and is perfect for **serverless applications**.

## Installation

1. Install your full-stack framework (SvelteKit, Next)
2. Enter the main directory of your application (if you are not already inside it)
3. Run `npm init @digitak/gravity` and follow the instructions

Once the installation is finished, you should have this project structure:

```
📂 src
  📃 api.ts
  📃 schema.json
  📂 services
    📃 Context.ts
    📃 Service.ts
    📃 index.ts
... other files depending on your framework
```
