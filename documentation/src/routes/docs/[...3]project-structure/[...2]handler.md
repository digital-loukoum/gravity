# Handler

The handler is the entry point of your server. Its role is to receive and handle incoming client requests.

:::admonition type="note"
If you are integrating **Gravity** with a back-end framework like **SvelteKit** or **Nuxt**, read the specific usage and location of your handler file:

- define Gravity handler with [SvelteKit](/docs/frameworks/svelte-kit),
- define Gravity handler with [Next](/docs/frameworks/next),
- define Gravity handler with [Nuxt](/docs/frameworks/nuxt).

```typescript
import { createServer } from 'http';
import { defineHandler } from '@digitak/gravity';

import type { Context } from './services/Context';
import { services } from './services';
import schema from './schema.json';

const PORT = 3000;

const { handler } = defineHandler({
	services,
	schema
	// additional options go there
});

const server = createServer(handler);

server.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`Gravity server listening to port ${PORT} ✨`);
});
```

A Gravity server is very close to a vanilla node server, which allows for deep customization.
